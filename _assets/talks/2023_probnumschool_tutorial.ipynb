    "# Practical Session: Probabilistic Numerics for ODEs\n",
    "Author: [Nathanael Bosch](https://nathanaelbosch.github.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will **implement your own ODE filter, completely from scratch!** \n",
    "The tutorial is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. [**The ODE**](#problem-setting)  \n",
    "   The guiding example for this tutorial will be an epidemeological dynamical system: a so-called SIRD model.\n",
    "   It is a simple model that describes how a disease evolves over time in a population.\n",
    "1. [**Solve an ODE with forward Euler**](#forward-euler)  \n",
    "   The \"hello world\" of solving ODEs. \n",
    "   Forward Euler is a very simple, non-probabilistic ODE solver. \n",
    "   We will use it to perform first simulations of the SIRD model, and we will visualize the solution and the numerical errors - _which are not quantified by the algorithm_.\n",
    "2. _Towards ODE filters:_ [**Gauss-Markov priors and Gaussian inference**](#prior)  \n",
    "   ODE filters essentially perform nonlinear Gauss-Markov regression.\n",
    "   So, in this next step we explore these Gauss-Markov priors and get more familiar with Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "   We  \n",
    "   &nbsp; &nbsp; + [sample from a Gauss--Markov prior](#sampling)  \n",
    "   &nbsp; &nbsp; + implement Gaussian [marginalization](#marginalization) and [conditioning](#affine-conditioning)  \n",
    "   &nbsp; &nbsp; + condition on non-linear observations by [linearizing](#linearization) the model  \n",
    "   These are the main algorithmic building blocks that we need for _extended Kalman filtering_; next, we turn it into an _ODE filter_.\n",
    "3. [**The ODE information operator**](#information-operator)  \n",
    "   In this section we define they key component of the ODE filter: the _information operator_.\n",
    "   This is the part that turns an extended Kalman filter into an ODE solver! \n",
    "4. Putting things together: [**Your first ODE filter**](#ode-filtering)  \n",
    "   We assemble all of the above to build an ODE filter, and we use it to solve the SIRD model.\n",
    "   We will visualize the posterior and its uncertainties, and again look at the numerical error - _and this time also at error estimates_! \n",
    "5. [**Calibrating uncertainties**](#calibration)  \n",
    "   It turns out that there is still one thing left to do: We need to calibrate the error estimates.\n",
    "   So, we implement a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation for the one free _diffusion_ hyperparameter, and get a _calibrated_ ODE filter.\n",
    "   We solve the ODE again, visualize it, and get meaningful posteriors!\n",
    "\n",
    "**At this point you will have implemented your own ODE filter, completely from scratch!**  \n",
    "There is one more section where we use these filters, not to solve an ODE but inside of an inference problem:   \n",
    "\n",
    "6. [**Parameter inference**](#parameter-inference)  \n",
    "   Sometimes you don't want to infer the solution from the ODE, but infer the ODE itself from some data. This is what we'll consider in this _parameter inference_ part.\n",
    "   We will use our ODE filter implementation to do some maximum-likelihood estimation of the SIRD parameters (the contact rate, recovery rate, and death rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After all of this, if you still have time and are curious for more, there are two directions you could go:\n",
    "there is still quite some functionality that one would want to have when using ODE filters, so you could have a look at [this list](#more) and explore these.\n",
    "Or you could simply check out our [software packages](#software)! They provide feature-rich ODE filters which are implemented very efficiently, and there are many tutorials to guide you through both basic and more avanced use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "So without further ado, **let's get started!**"

    "ProbNum is a Python toolkit which provides probabilistic numerical methods not only for ODEs, but for a whole range of numerical problems in linear algebra, optimization, quadrature and differential equations.\n",
    "It also contains quite a large range of methods for Bayesian filtering and smoothing that you can use to build your own probabilistic ODE solvers.\n",
    "To learn more, have a look at its excellent documentation and the many tutorials [here](https://probnum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
