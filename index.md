I am a PhD student in machine learning at the University of TÃ¼bingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/personen/philipp-hennig/).
I'm interested in probabilistic machine learning _for_ and _with_ dynamical systems,
with a focus on [**probabilistic numerics**](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/):
by treating numerical simulation as a probabilistic inference problem, we develop new methods that efficiently quantify their numerical error and enable new ways to do data-driven inference in dynamical systems.

I also like to make my research widely accessible in the form of open-source software:
[ProbNumDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/nathanaelbosch/ProbNumDiffEq.jl)
provides efficient probabilistic numerical differential equation solvers in Julia that are compatible with the broader [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai) ecosystem - and it contains nearly all the methods that I published in my PhD.
I also contributed to the [probnum](https://probnum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) probabilistic numerics toolkit, and I maintain a range of smaller Julia packages.
Check out the [code](/code/) section!
