I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Mathematics for Materials Modelling](https://matmat.org/) group
at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) where I work on **Bayesian optimization for inverse materials design**, supervised by [Prof. Michael F. Herbst](https://michael-herbst.com/).
Before that, I completed my PhD in machine learning at the University of Tübingen and the [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) under [Prof. Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/personen/philipp-hennig/) on [probabilistic numerical methods](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/) for ordinary differential equations; see my PhD thesis ["A Flexible and Efficient Framework for Probabilistic Numerical Simulation and Inference"](https://tobias-lib.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/165521).
I'm broadly interested in the intersection of probabilistic machine learning and scientific computing, including topics such as probabilistic numerics, Bayesian optimization, state-space models, differential equations, and Gaussian processes.

I like to make my research widely accessible in the form of open-source software:
[ProbNumDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/nathanaelbosch/ProbNumDiffEq.jl)
provides efficient probabilistic numerical differential equation solvers in Julia that are compatible with the broader [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai) ecosystem — it contains nearly all the methods that I developed during my PhD.
I also contributed to the [probnum](https://probnum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) probabilistic numerics toolkit
and maintain a range of smaller Julia packages, such as
[TuePlots.jl](https://github.com/nathanaelbosch/TuePlots.jl) for making publication-ready plots with Makie.
Check out the [code](/code/) section!
